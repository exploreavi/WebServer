Please forgive my brevity of features. I could do only following in this limited time.

Done
--	File WebServer only.
--	CRUD operations for ascii files.
--	Run as non-root only
--	Bound to localhost loop-back only
--	Config.xml - few entries used for demonstration.
--      FileNames should resolve to a regular file. Operation on directory would result in "Forbidden".
Not done
--	Synchronize threads for unsafe request(POST, PUT, DELETE). 
--	Binary files not tested.
--	Keep Alive timeout not implemented yet.
--	Multiple-part form not implemented.
--	Did not use query params though they have been parsed and are available in a hash.
--	Clients like curl, wget, siege not working for all http methods.
--	Files with white spaces and special characters etc. not tested.
--	Header Content-Type: not used.
--	Should modify file if and only if system user owns it.
--	Tested only on Ubuntu.
--	Not tested with IPv6.
--	What happens if a request results in an exception. Simple, that thread is gone!!
-- 	Could not write Unit Test cases.
-- 	Could do Performance test.
--      Config file existence not checked.
--      Directory listing not implemented.

BUILD:
-----
// user java 1.7 because of getLoopbackAddress
1) Go to directory containing directory "webserver".
2) javac -cp . webserver/*.java

RUN:
----
1) Go to directory containing directory "webserver".
2) Execute "java webserver.WebServer".

HOW I HAVE TESTED SO FAR:
--------------------------
--> I have used telnet client to test the keep-alive feature. 
    Because I can create raw request.
--> Other clients will not work as I have not handled all headers and their values.
--> HTTP-Request is not closed until request contains "Connection: close" header.
--> The connection also gets closed if either server or client terminates.
